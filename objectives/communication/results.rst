- Purchases → payments to suppliers.
- End of month process lasts 2 days.
- Goal: show what happens on the month.
- HR is here now, but there was a time when they worked as it.
- They have an anual budget which arises where we want to go.
- No distinction on external teams, but they need to know which team to reach
  when problem occurs. In example:

  .. code-block:: text

  Finanzas → Comercial → Operations

- It is a support area. Everybody needs them.
- Everybody in the company come to us to capture in numbers and understand why.
- Others enterprises and/or business units are informed with Financial data.
- Travellers rely on them.
- All legal documentation is processed in this area. Each contract sign with
  any provider passes through them; they are the nexus with Law Firm.
- They do not use team's KPIs; every work is on demand.
