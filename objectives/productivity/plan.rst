Progress
--------

**2016-08-16**
  Created a `meeting detail`_ for next Friday 19.

**2016-08-19**
  Meeting was partially completed: just one topic point was discussed. The
  notion was that all topics cannot be faced in a single hour and the team was
  incomplete (Agustina Biscayart was in her hollidays). I talked to Carola
  Rimoldi about taking the team to an external event in an isolated location,
  as renting a room in `Urban Station`_.

**2016-08-31**
  Have a chat with Rodrigo Miró to aprove renting a room in `Urban Station`_.

**2016-09-01**
  Developers metrics to use needs to be consensuated; this particular objective
  is **abandoned**.

**2016-09-02**  
  Sent meeting details to talk about in there, price and rent requirements.

**2016-09-19**
  Re-scheduled due date for hollidays.
