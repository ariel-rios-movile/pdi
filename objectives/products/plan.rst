Progress
--------

**2016-08-10**
  - I've created a Feedly collection with multiple web blogs and magazines for
    my every day reading.
  - I've created a meeting with Joca Neto for 2016-08-11T14:00 AR to talk about
    base analytics configurations for every web/mobile project.
    
**2016-08-11**
  Meeting with Joca Neto could not be done, since he was not available.
  Tomorrow will try to contact him to re-schedule it.

**2016-09-01**
  Meeting with Joca Neto for Analytics. We identified the following as required
  by each web project:

  *What kind of metrics should came de facto in any web project?*

    - Default GA
    - Session
    - Users
    - Pages seen (track every page)
    - Average session time
    - Bounce rate by country by product
    - Subscribed users
    - Unsubscribed users
    - Origens (by GET parameter)
    - E-comerce tracking.
  
  *What kind of policies does exist about sharing access to this data by
  external people?*

    - None. We should include Office team to mangage access in order to remove
      gone people.
