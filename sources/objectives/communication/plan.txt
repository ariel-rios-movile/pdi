  - Created a meeting at 2016-08-11T14:00 with Gabriela Simonassi to talk about
    how Financial team sees IT team and how we could collaborate with that
    team.

  next week. 1 possible problem identified on both of them.

  perspectives & points of view.

**2016-08-30**
  Meet with Franco Maffasanti and talked about current Media problems and how
  IT could help. Leave meeting with following TODOs:

  #. Check for an automatic ROI report tool on BI side. Since ROI is the most
     important KPI for Media team and the must do it manually, it will boost
     productivity.
  #. Contact Renato Carneiro to know how error reporting flow must be applied
     for new discrepances found in *estrategy* tool.
  #. Choose an open source adserver and test it on a development environment.
