Teams organization
------------------

Comercial
~~~~~~~~~

- Estefanía is in charge of operators contact.
- Nicolás takes the corporative messaging business, micropayment and IVR.
- They do not have budget; based on proposed awards for promotions they make an
  analysis on how much we can posibly win.
- Alliance and expansion is a target for short/medium term.
- Long term vision is difficult.
- The ideal organization: Sebastián takes search of new business and daily
  tasks for Nicolás and Estefanía.
- Comercial generency is hunted by results.
- SAT PUSH business produces high carrier dependency, but unless there are
  better options they will be following it.
- Jira: they don't see it nor use it; they use paper and Excel where Sebastián
  has the weekly objectives.
- *Product usability is worthless because the way we capture users is wrong*.

        CPA: pay on new subscription
        CPC: pay on click

  2. Quality:

     1. New subscriptor
     2. Cancellations
     3. Billiability  

- They are learning to work as an agency.
- The way to buy advertising spaces is by bid.
- RTB: Real Time Binding
- BID + Performance -> how it converts

.. code-block:: text

   | Banner | --- (click) ---> | step 1 | --- (click) ---> | success |

                 Click to rate               Conversion rate

- Volume generation is the first step.
- Faudulent subscriptions occurs when someone is cheating on clicks.
- The best target is ROI at 3 months.
- They talk a lot with competitors.
- They give a try into everything.
- They want to integrate into Twitter but it is not a short term objective.

Product
~~~~~~~

- They use Jira to communicate with other teams (new features, bugs). They also
  have their own project but each status is not updated.
- They also uses Trello: daily tasks and per project, but they does not make
  use of it.
- The inquietude borns in Pablo and they stream it to the team; never in
  backwards.
- Think Big!: Pablo makes validations and makes lean progress.

Financial + Adminstration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Purchases → payments to suppliers.
- End of month process lasts 2 days.
- Goal: show what happens on the month.
- HR is here now, but there was a time when they worked as it.
- They have an anual budget which arises where we want to go.
- No distinction on external teams, but they need to know which team to reach
  when problem occurs. In example:

.. code-block:: text

   Finanzas → Comercial → Operations

- It is a support area. Everybody needs them.
- Everybody in the company come to us to capture in numbers and understand why.
- Others enterprises and/or business units are informed with Financial data.
- Travellers rely on them.
- All legal documentation is processed in this area. Each contract sign with
  any provider passes through them; they are the nexus with Law Firm.
- They do not use team's KPIs; every work is on demand.

TODO

Collaboration oportunities
--------------------------

Comercial
~~~~~~~~~

- Perception problems: IT does a lot of things that they cannot see nor have
  any value for them, like integrations. A proposed alternative is that not
  everyone in IT works in that kind of tasks.

- Consolidation problems: there are a lot of statistical tools and each one
  throws different results and none gives what they need.

Media
~~~~~
